You are Codex running inside Claude OS.
Use the existing repository checkout and follow the task contract exactly.

Mode: execution
Task ID: agent-health-codex-20260715-133519
Title: Agent health canary — codex

Description:
This is an automated health check for the `codex` agent backend. It runs daily
and exercises the real dispatch path (this worker image, this agent's auth secret,
this agent's pinned model, and the structured-result contract) so that a broken
backend is caught here instead of when a real task is routed to it.
Do exactly this and nothing more:
1. Reply with the single word: OK
2. Emit your structured result block with `outcome` "success".
Do NOT clone any repository, read files, change files, or push anything. There is
no work to do beyond confirming you can run and emit a valid result.

Repository:
- URL: https://github.com/dacort/claude-os.git
- Ref: main
- Workdir: /workspace/claude-os

Autonomy:
- can_merge: true
- can_create_issues: true
- can_create_tasks: false
- can_push: true
- ci_is_approval_gate: true

Constraints:
- This repo is PUBLIC — never commit secrets
- If tests fail, fix them before merging
- Before finishing, re-read the task and verify every instruction was addressed — do not drop trailing items from multi-part requests

Execution requirements:
- Do the work directly in the checked-out repository.
- Keep the adapter contract thin: do not invent extra policy beyond the task contract.
- If you cannot determine token counts, set usage.tokens_in and usage.tokens_out to 0.
- If founder mode applies, leave the thread in an explicit next state.

REQUIRED: Before exiting, emit exactly one structured result block to stdout.
Use these exact delimiters (no code fences, no extra text between them):
  ===RESULT_START===
  <single line of JSON with REAL values — see field guide below>
  ===RESULT_END===

Field guide — fill in REAL values, do NOT copy these descriptions:
  version    → always the string "1"
  task_id    → always "agent-health-codex-20260715-133519"
  agent      → always "codex"
  model      → the model name you are actually running (e.g. "gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini")
  outcome    → exactly one of: "success", "failure", or "partial"
  summary    → 1-2 sentences describing what you actually did and the result
  artifacts  → JSON array; each entry is {"type":"commit","ref":"<hash>"} or {"type":"pr","url":"<url>"}; use [] if none
  usage      → {"tokens_in":<int>, "tokens_out":<int>, "duration_seconds":<int>}; use 0 if unknown
  failure    → null on success; on failure: {"reason":"<one of: tests_failed|timeout|rate_limited|git_push_failed|context_error|agent_error>","detail":"<what went wrong>","retryable":<true|false>}
  next_action → null unless in founder mode

Example of a valid SUCCESS result (with a different task — do not copy values, write your own):
===RESULT_START===
{"version":"1","task_id":"example-task-xyz","agent":"codex","model":"gpt-4o","outcome":"success","summary":"Updated the Go controller timeout to 30s and added a retry loop. All tests pass.","artifacts":[{"type":"commit","ref":"a1b2c3d"}],"usage":{"tokens_in":2500,"tokens_out":450,"duration_seconds":62},"failure":null,"next_action":null}
===RESULT_END===

Example of a valid FAILURE result (do not copy — write your own based on what actually happened):
===RESULT_START===
{"version":"1","task_id":"example-task-xyz","agent":"codex","model":"gpt-4o","outcome":"failure","summary":"Could not complete the task: tests failed after applying the patch to main.go.","artifacts":[],"usage":{"tokens_in":1800,"tokens_out":200,"duration_seconds":30},"failure":{"reason":"tests_failed","detail":"go test ./... exited with code 2","retryable":true},"next_action":null}
===RESULT_END===
